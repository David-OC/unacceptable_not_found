# unacceptable_not_found
This re-writes the command_not_found function in bash and zsh 

##You must heed my INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!!!

Run the addsource.bash script to source the bash or zsh function when you login.

Next time you login and run a command that cannot be found, you should be told that your input is unacceptable.
